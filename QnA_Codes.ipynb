       "Document(page_content='2 Review the BAIS  Program : The MS BAIS  Program curriculum includes  6 required courses and 6 electives.  Plan included below.  Some of \\nthese courses have prerequisites.  See https://www.usf.edu/business/graduate/masters/bais/coursework.aspx  for more on the \\ncoursework.  \\nMS BAIS  Program Technical Core  Classes  - (required ): \\n• ISM 6 124 – Advanced Systems Analysis and Design  (requires a systems analysis or software engineering prerequisite)  \\n• ISM 6 218 – Advanced Database Administration  (requires a database prerequisite)  \\n• ISM 6 225 – Distributed Information Systems  (should have completed  the Object -Orien ted programming prerequisite)  \\n• QMB 6 304 – Analytical Methods for Business  \\n• ISM 6 155 – Enterprise Information Systems Management  \\n• ISM 6945 – BAIS Internship  - required prerequisites: Analytical Methods for Business (QMB 6304), Advanced Database (ISM \\n6218) and  Data Mining (ISM 6136)  \\nMS BAIS  Program Electives  – (17 credits) : \\n• These are generally the 6000 level , 3-credit ISM courses .   \\n• Relevant courses from other departments across USF can be used with prior approval . However,  classes out of our \\ndepartment (non -ISM or MAN ) MUST be approved before you assume it can be used as part of the MS BAIS degree.      \\nBI Concentration - SAS/USF Analytics and Business Intelligence  Graduate Certificate – If you are interested in this, plan y our \\nschedule to include  4 of the courses listed at http://catalog.usf.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=9&poid=2813&returnto=996 .  \\nThese classes  can be used as your electives .  \\nCourse Sequencing notes: The MS BAIS program gives you the opportunity to develop deep expertise in an area by taking \\ncourses in the area in a sequence in 2/3 consecutive semesters. You will get the most by following one or more of these \\nsequences depending on your expertise and career focus .  \\n• Data Science :  Recommended c ourse Sequence:  Data Mining -> Data Science Programming -> Big Dat a for Business \\nApplications.  \\n• Application Development : Recommended c ourse Sequence : Distributed Information Systems -> Big Data for Business \\nApplications.  \\n• Data Analytics using Statistics : Recommended c ourse Sequence:   Analytical Methods in Business -> Statistical Data Mining  \\nPlease refrain from registering  for one of the later courses in a sequence without completing the prior classes in the sequence in \\norder to get the most of out of these courses . This also helps students in the later courses benefit from a deeper coverage of the \\nmaterial.  \\nMake a tentative plan – The MS BAIS  degree requires 33 credits  plus any outstanding prerequisites.  You’ll want to plan out your \\ncoursework based on  your expected graduation date.   \\nA few notes on this:  \\n• The fall and spring each have a 12-week  session and a 4-week  session.  This means you can take classes during the 12 -week \\nsession and also take a class in a 4-week  session.    The 4 -week sessions class es usually meet twice a week at night and on \\nSaturday mornings.   In the spring , these accelerated classes are offered in January.  In the fall they are offered  late -\\nNovember through mid -December.  \\n• The spring session often offers a 1 week, 3 credit class du ring spring break that meets every day, all day.    \\n• In early summer, we often  offer a 4 week ‘Maymester’ class , where  possible . \\n• It’s strongly recommended to take all of your core classes during the fall and spring.   Summer is a difficult time to complete \\nrequired courses since  there are often fewer classes offered  and many students use summer to complete a summer  \\ninternship as an independent study course.  It’s best if you leave your electives for the summer term(s).  \\n• Some good classes to start wit h are:  \\no Required First Semester Classes (you’ll be automatically registered for these courses) : ', metadata={'source': './Data/MS_BAIS_New_Students.pdf', 'page': 1})"

This document is intended to help you get ready to \\njoin us.  Please contact Prof. Barbara Warner ( bwarner@usf.edu ) with any questions.  \\nGetting Started  - New Student Checklist:  \\n1) Review our New Student PDF at http://www.usf.edu/business/graduate/masters/bais/new -student.aspx  \\n2) Register for our department’s orientation via http://usfweb.usf.edu/business/forms/bais -orientation -register.aspx  by July 15 . It \\nis tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 18 , at 8:30 am.  At this time, orientation is planned to be on -campus. Registering for \\norientation  lets us know of your intent to attend so we can send you notifications relating to your start at USF. NOTE :  if you are \\nplanning to attend USF in the upcoming semester, but cannot attend orientation, please register for the event anyway and note  \\nyour inab ility to attend in the ‘Expected Date of Arrival’ area.   There is no admissions deposit required by USF .  Additionally, there \\nis an Office of Graduate Studies orientation as well as our department orientation.  Both are valuable , but we only require the \\ndepartment orientation.  \\n3) Complete the academic integrity course (you’ll be enrolled after I receive your orientation request)  \\n4) Request a prerequisite review.  Email me at bwarner@usf.edu  with your U number.   \\nA list of required prerequisites can be found on our FAQ page at http://www.usf.edu/business/graduate/masters/bais/faq.aspx  .    \\nWith careful course planning,  prerequisite s can be done before joining the program or while in the program .  Note:  if you have not \\nmet the technical prerequisites, you’ll be required to take those classes on -campus at USF before taking the more advanced \\ntechnical courses.   Students that need to complete technical prerequisites will remain on hold until they requested permission to \\nenroll in USF prerequisite courses or  have provided evidence of completing the prerequisites.     \\n5) Clear your immunization and insurance holds with Student Health Services.  \\nStudent Health Service information can be found at http://www.usf.edu/student -affairs/student -health -services .  Immunization \\ninformation is at http://www.usf.edu/student -affairs/student -health -services/immunizations , there are phone numbers and an \\nemail address available at this site  \\n6) Send a copy of your visa to me at bwar ner@usf.edu  as soon as you get it .  If you do not require a visa / are a domestic student , \\nsend an email and let me know . \\n7) Once all of this is done, email me with your U number and request course registration for the fall.   I’ll then clear the MS \\ndepartment hold on your account   and register you for our 3 starting classes.  \\n**All incoming students are required to take Advance d Database (ISM 6218), Analytical Methods for Business (QMB 6304) and Data \\nMining (ISM 6136).  You will be registered for these classes automatically .  If you want to enroll in additional fall courses, you can \\nregister via Oasis (see links in #3, above).  You can see each semester’s schedule at \\nhttps://usfweb.usf.edu/DSS/StaffScheduleSearch  .   NOTE:  If you  register for additional classes and  receive a message saying you \\nhave not been assigned a  ‘time slot’ for registration, please call the registrar’s office at 813 -974-2000.   International students \\nrequiring a visa to attend need to send a copy of their visa ( bwarner@usf.edu ) before registration can be completed.    \\nCovid update: If you plan to take your fall classes remotely, please email me to plan your schedule . \\nSome additional Resources:  \\nPaying tuition, etc. (see https://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/admission -information/cost -of-attendance/payment -\\nmethods.aspx  ).
